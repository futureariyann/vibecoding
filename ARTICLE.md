# 🚀 Vibes Coding: The 2026 Architect's Manifesto

> *"Coding is no longer about typing syntax. It's about **managing intent**, **curating context**, and **vibrating at the right frequency**."*
> — Andrej Karpathy (paraphrased), Software 3.0

## 🧠 1. The Paradigm Shift

**You are no longer the bricklayer.** In the "Software 2.0" era, you worried about semicolons and memory management.

In **2026**, the AI is the bricklayer. **You are the Site Manager.**

### Your New Job Description:
*   **Define the Vibe:** Set the aesthetic, performance, and UX goals.
*   **Architect the Context:** Feed the *right* files to the AI to prevent hallucinations.
*   **Review the Work:** Perform "Vibe Checks" on the output.

---

## 🏗️ 2. The Context Architecture

**AI hallucinations are just context failures.** It guesses because it doesn't *know*. You need a rigid file structure to ground the AI.

### 📄 `AGENT.md` (The Constitution)
**The soul of your agent.** Defines *who* it is and *how* it behaves.
*   **Role:** "You are a Senior Architect."
*   **Constraint:** "Never use `any`."
*   **Behavior:** "If a file is >200 lines, refactor it."

### 📚 `SKILL.md` (The Knowledge Base)
**The "Legacy Code" killer.** Tells the agent *exactly* which stack to use.
*   *Rule:* "Use Tailwind v4."
*   *Rule:* "Use Drizzle ORM."
*   *Rule:* "Use Hono for API routes."

### 🧠 `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (The Memory)
**The external hippocampus.** AI has no long-term memory; this file stores it.
*   **Before you quit:** "Update `PROJECT_STATUS.md` with what we did."
*   **When you return:** The agent reads this and instantly knows where it left off.

## ⚡️ 3. The 3 Operational Modes

**Stop the AI from rushing.** Explicitly switch its "cognitive mode" to match the task.

### 🧠 Mode 1: PLAN (The Architect)
*   **Goal:** Define the "What" and "Why" before the "How."
*   **Tooling:** Read-only access + Web Search.
*   **Prompt:** *"Switch to PLAN MODE. Read `schema.ts`. Outline the DB changes for 'Team Settings' in `plan.md`."*

### 🔨 Mode 2: BUILD (The Engineer)
*   **Goal:** Execute the plan with high precision.
*   **Tooling:** Write access, Terminal, Linter.
*   **Prompt:** *"Switch to BUILD MODE. Execute Step 1 from `plan.md`. Update `schema.ts` and run migrations."*

### 🐛 Mode 3: DEBUG (The Detective)
*   **Goal:** Fix the vibe when it feels "off."
*   **Tooling:** Logs, Debugger, MCP (Database Inspection).
*   **Prompt:** *"Switch to DEBUG MODE. The form isn't saving. Check server logs and DB structure."*

## 🛠️ 4. MCPs & Plugins

In 2026, the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** allows your AI to "touch" the real world securely.

| Tool / MCP | Purpose | Why it's essential |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PostgreSQL MCP** | **DB Direct Access** | Run real queries to verify data exists. |
| **Brave Search MCP** | **Live Docs** | Check the latest library syntax in real-time. |
| **Filesystem MCP** | **Deep Search** | `grep` the entire repo to find definitions instantly. |
| **GitHub MCP** | **PR Management** | Automate PR summaries and issue linking. |

---

## 💻 5. The 2026 Tech Stack

**Why this stack?** Because it "vibes" best with AI reasoning.

| Layer | Technology | Why it Vibes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | **Next.js 16 + Tailwind v4** | **Token Efficiency.** AI understands `flex-center` better than verbose CSS. |
| **Backend** | **Hono (RPC)** | **Type Safety.** AI cannot hallucinate endpoints; shared types forbid it. |
| **Database** | **Drizzle ORM** | **Schema-as-Code.** AI reads `schema.ts` and knows your *entire* data model. |
| **Infra** | **Docker + Coolify** | **Standardization.** AI writes perfect Dockerfiles. |

---

## 🛡️ 6. The Control Plane (Scaling Up)

For large projects, a single prompt isn't enough. You need a **Corporate Hierarchy**.

*   **CEO (`AGENTS.md`)**: The "Router". Sets the mission.
*   **Managers (`.vibes/control/`)**: Enforce rules (e.g., `SECURITY.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md`).
*   **Workers (`.vibes/sop/`)**: Step-by-step guides (e.g., `UI_WORKFLOW.md`, `DB_MIGRATION.md`).
*   **Archive (`.vibes/memory/`)**: Past decisions (e.g., `DECISION_LOG.md`).

---

## 🤖 7. The Model Meta (2026)

**Choose the right brain for the job.**

*   🎨 **Frontend:** **Kimi k2.5** (The Visualist) - "Sees" Figma, outputs Tailwind.
*   ⚙️ **Logic:** **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** (The Logician) - Lowest hallucination rate.
*   🏗️ **Refactoring:** **Gemini 3 Pro** (The Librarian) - Infinite context window.
*   ⚡ **Quick Fixes:** **Llama 4** (The Sprinter) - <100ms latency.

> **Final Thought:**
> The best code in 2026 isn't written. **It's curated.**
