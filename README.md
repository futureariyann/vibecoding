# 🚀 Vibes Coding Guide (v3.0)

Welcome to the **Vibes Coding Guide**, a comprehensive framework for managing AI coding agents in the "Software 3.0" era. This repository provides the **Context Architecture** needed to minimize hallucinations and maximize developer intent.

## 📂 Directory Structure

This repository is structured as a "Corporate Hierarchy" for AI agents:

```bash
vibes-coding-guide/
├── ARTICLE.md              # The Manifesto: "Vibes Coding: The Architect's Manifesto (2026)"
├── AGENT.md                # The CEO: The main router that directs the AI to the right SOP.
├── SKILL.md                # The Knowledge Base: The tech stack and core recipes.
├── PROJECT_STATUS.md       # The Memory: Persistent context of the project's state.
│
└── .vibes/                 # The Control Plane (Advanced Architecture)
    ├── control/            # The Managers: Governance and Safety rules (Placeholders).
    ├── memory/             # The Archive: Decision logs and immutable facts (Placeholders).
    └── sop/                # The Workers: Step-by-step Standard Operating Procedures.
        ├── UI_WORKFLOW.md      # How to build UI (Components, Storybook, Tailwind).
        ├── BACKEND_WORKFLOW.md # How to build Backend (API, DB, Auth).
        └── DEBUG_WORKFLOW.md   # How to fix bugs (Reproduction protocol).
```

## 📄 File Descriptions

### 1. The Core Documents

*   **`ARTICLE.md`**: The full guide explaining the philosophy of "Vibes Coding," the 2026 Tech Stack (Next.js 16, Hono, Drizzle), and the 3 Operational Modes (Plan, Build, Debug). Read this to understand the *Why*.
*   **`AGENT.md` (The Constitution)**: This is the **System Prompt** for your AI. It defines the "Persona Matrix" (Architect vs. Engineer vs. Detective) and acts as the "Router" that tells the AI which SOP to read based on the task.
*   **`SKILL.md` (The Tech Stack)**: A rigid definition of your technology stack to prevent the AI from using outdated libraries. It contains "Procedural Recipes" for common tasks like "Database Migration."
*   **`PROJECT_STATUS.md` (The Context)**: A dynamic file that acts as the AI's "Short-Term Memory." Update this file at the end of every session so the AI knows where it left off.

### 2. The `.vibes/` Control Plane

This directory implements the **OpenAgentsControl** pattern, separating concerns into specialized files.

*   **`.vibes/sop/UI_WORKFLOW.md`**: Strict rules for frontend development (e.g., "No `useEffect` for data fetching", "Use shadcn/ui").
*   **`.vibes/sop/BACKEND_WORKFLOW.md`**: Strict rules for backend development (e.g., "Validate inputs with Zod", "Use Drizzle for migrations").
*   **`.vibes/sop/DEBUG_WORKFLOW.md`**: A mandatory protocol for fixing bugs (e.g., "Reproduce the bug with a test case *before* fixing it").

## 🚀 How To Use This

1.  **Copy**: Copy these files into the root of your new project.
2.  **Instruct**: Tell your AI agent (Cursor, Windsurf, or OpenCode):
    > "Read `AGENT.md` and `PROJECT_STATUS.md` to start."
3.  **Vibe**: Focus on defining the *intent* (the vibe) and let the agent handle the implementation using the strict SOPs defined in `.vibes/`.
